          The Senior Community Investment Manager at United Way Waterloo Region,
          Brian, said that one of the best parts of working with DecisionHub is
          “being able to get ahold of [them] in a timely fashion” as DecisionHub
          is a small team, and “one of the advantages of working with a smaller
          developer is the connection, and the time it takes to hear back”.
